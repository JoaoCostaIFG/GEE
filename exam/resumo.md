#### Equity

![BC_equity](img/bc_equity.png)

#### Liabilities

![BC_liabilities](img/bc_liabilities.png)

### Financial transactions

- **Permutative financial facts**:
  - Changes the composition of the company's patrimony;
  - Doesn't change the value of the patrimony.
- **Modifying financial facts**:
  - Changes the composition of the company's patrimony;
  - Changes the value of the patrimony.

### Income statement

Shows the results (profits or losses) in a certain financial period (**between 2
balance sheets**).

- Assesses the economic performance in the period;
- By **nature** - nature of the expenses and revenues (operating, financial,
  current);
- By **function** - classifies expenses according to their function as part of
  the cost of sales, distribution, or administration.

### Revenues

- **Revenues** - arises in the course of ordinary activities of an enterprise;
- **Gains** - represent other items that meet the definition of income and may,
  or may not, arise in the course of ordinary activities of an enterprise.

![income_statement_nature](img/income_statement_nature.png)

### Account

Set of financial items expressed in units of value. Main features:

- **Homogeneity** - must contain only elements that conform to the common
  characteristic that defines it;
- **Completeness** - must include all elements who enjoy the common feature set
  for it.

![account](img/account.png)

- **Principle of double entry** -
  $\sum debit\_movements = \sum credit\_movements$

### Financial flows

- **Financial** - operations carried out by the company with external entities.
  Related to the remuneration of factors and good and services sold (expenses
  and revenue);
- **Economic or Productive** - linked to the transformation and incorporation
  into the production process of various materials, labor, etc. until reaching
  the final good/service (costs and yields);
- **Cash Flow** - cash inflows and outflows of the company (receipts and
  payments).

### Depreciation and amortization

![deprec_amort](img/deprec_amort.png)

### Cash flow statement

Detailed historical information about what were the receipts and payments of a
company during a specific period of time => **demonstrates the company's ability
to generate cash**.

### Financial analysis

- Study of organization's overall financial performance;
- **Objective** - assessment of the economic and financial evolution of the
  company and its ability to generate profits and pay its Liabilities.

1. Understand the macro and industry context;
2. Systematize the information:

- Economic component - capability to generate profits, operational capability of
  the company (income statement);
- Financial component - capability to respond to pay its liabilities (balance
  sheet and cash-flow statement).

3. Structural, evolution and ratio analysis: liquidity, financial stability,
   etc...

### Analysis of return

- **Return on sales or production**:
  - Net earnings / sales or net income / production
  - **>0 - good; 5 to 10% - excellent**.
- **Return on assets (ROA)**:
  - ROA = net earnings / total assets
  - **>=5% - good; 20% - great**.
- **Return on equity (ROE)**:
  - ROE = net earnings / equity
  - **15 to 20%**.

### Measuring efficiency

- **Asset turnover**:
  - Asset turnover = sales or production / total assets
  - **higher is better**.
- **Avg. inventory period**:
  - (Inventory / cost of goods sold) \* 365
  - **lower is better**.
- **Avg. collection period**:
  - (accounts receivables / sales) \* 365
  - **lower is better**.
- **Avg. payment period**:
  - (accounts payable / purchases) \* 365
  - **it depends**:
    - lower may signal opportunities of reinvestment of capital being lost;
    - higher might show inadequate cash flows.

### Measuring liquidity - short-term

- **Current ratio**:
  - current assets / current liabilities
  - **>= 1** significa que a empresa consegue pagar dinheiro loaned/account
    payable;
  - Se for muito alto, pode indicar que a empresa está a deixar muito dinheiro
    de lado em vez de o investir.
- **Quick (acid-test) ratio**:
  - (cash + marketable securities + receivables) / current liabilities
  - **>= 1** (short term assets dão para cobrir as current liabilities);
- **Cash ratio**:
  - (cash + marketable securities) / current liabilities
  - Similar ao acid;
  - Medida conservadora.
- Working capital = current assets - current liabilities
  - **>1** indica que empresa consegue fund its current operations and
    investments;
  - lower values may indicate risk of distress.

### Measuring liquidity - long-term

- **Equity to assets ratio**:
  - equity / total assets
  - **higher is better**.
  - 75% means company has financed 75% of its assets with shareholder equity;
  - meaning that only 25% is funded by debt;
  - If company liquidated all of its assets to pay off its debt, the
    shareholders would retain 75% of the company's financial resources.
- **Debt to equity**:
  - debt / equity
  - **High => high risk**;
  - Used to gauge to what extent a company is taking on debt as means to
    leverage its assets.
- **Coverage of fixed investments**:
  - (equity + long-term debt) / fixed assets
- **Interest coverage**:
  - EBIT / interest
  - **<= 1.5 - not so good**;
  - Ability to meet interest expenses may be questionable;
  - Used to easure how well a firm can pay the interest due on outstanding debt.

## Marketing

### Os 7 P's of marketing mix

- Product - variety, quality, design, etc...
- Price - list price, discounts, credit, etc...

  and which will be the product development strategy. How is the product
  positioned in the face of competitors;
- **Price** - an important decision that should support the company's strategy:
  - **Penetration strategy** - price is used as a strategy to increase sales;

  serviço prestado;
- **Physical evidence** - style and visual env where the service is provided
  (e.g. hotel);

## Segmentation

- Customers are all different;
- Para corresponder às necessidades do client, é important identificar **market
  segments**:
  - Identificar groupos de customers, diferentes de outros grupos, com
    preferências similars.
- Para set efetivo:
  - measurable - medir tamanho, poder de compra, etc...
  - substantial - large and profitable enough;
  - accessible - can be reached;
  - differentiable - customers devem estar dispostos a pagar por uma oferta
    distinta;
  - actionable - company deve conseguir satisfazer.

### Levels of segmentation

#### Mass marketing

- Desenvolvimento de um único **marketing mix**;
- É comunicado a todos os customers num global market;
- Least cost production paradigm: e.g. Fort T.

#### Segment marketing

- Development of solutions adapted to the specific needs of the different market
  segments;

![customer_archetypes](img/customer_archetypes.png)

#### Niche marketing

- Adaptation of the company's offering to a **small segment of customers** with
  specific needs and preferences;
- **Niche** - narrow customer group seeking a distinctive mix of benefits or
  values;
- **The long tail** - o advento da internet turnou niche marketing muito mais
  profitable. ![long_tail](img/long_tail.png)

#### Marketing one-to-one

- Adaptation of the company's offering to the individual customer preferences;
- Exemplo de mercados tradicionais, como por exemplo sapateiros;
- Com as novas tecnologias, isto também é possível com **mass customization**:
  tipo com as empresas que deixam customizar as partes dos PCs.

### Segmentation variables

- **Geographic segmentation** - adaptar ao local de venda (Expresso no McDonalds
  em Portugal);
- **Socio-demographic segmentation** - idade, gender, income. professional
  status, education;
- **Psychographic segmentation** - traços de personalidade, lifestyle, valores,
  opiniões, etc...
- **Behavioral segmentation** - knowledge, attitude toward, use of, and response
  to a product, etc...

### Selecting target markets

Tendo em conta a attractiveness dos segments, e os objetivos e os recursos da
empresa, podem definir-se várias estratégias.

- **Single-segment concentration** - A empresa concentra-se em servir um segment
  particularmente bem:
  - Vantagens: especialização e conhecimento profundo do segment;
  - Desvantagens: dependencia num único segment;
  - Exemplo: banco BIG.

![single_seg](img/single_seg.png)

- **Selective specialization** - A empresa seleciona um grupo de segments, cada
  um atraente e apropriado:
  - Vantagens: risk diversification;
  - Desvantagens: effort dispersion.
  - Exemplo: Sonae.

![selective_speci](img/selective_speci.png)

- **Product/service specialization** - A empresa especializa-se num produto que
  é vendido a diferentes market segments:
  - Vantagens: pode usar imagem/reputação em vários mercados;
  - Desvantagens: o produto pode ser suplantado por uma tecnologia completamente
    nova/diferente;
  - Exemplo: Amorim.

![prod_speci](img/prod_speci.png)

- **Market specialization** - A empresa concentra-se em servir muitas
  necessidades de um segmento em particular:
  - Vantagens: ganho de reputação com o segment;
  - Desvantagens: risco de redução/desaparecer do segment;
  - Exemplo: Vista Alegre, Atlantis.
- **Full market coverage** - A empresa tenta servir todos os segments em todas
  as suas necessidades:
  - Vantagens: broad market coverage, satisfying a wide range of customer needs;
  - Desvantagens: high costs;
  - Exemplo: Financial conglomerates.

## Positioning

- É o ato de desenhar a oferta e imagem da empresa de modo a ocupar um lugar
  distinto na mente do target market;
- Reflete a estratégia e vantagens competitivas da empresa:
  - Uma oferta valorizada pelos customers;
  - É unique e diferente da competição;
  - **Dificil de imitar**.
- **Category membership** - as ofertas de mercado com as quais a marca compete
  (funcionam como substitutos próximos);
- **Point of difference** - attributes or expected benefits that are strongly
  associated with the offering, com valor para o customer, e que **não estão na
  oferta da competição**.
- **Point of parity** - attributes que não são necessáriamente únicos para a
  oferta da empresa:
  - **Category points of parity** - consumers view them as essential for a brand
    to be credible in a certain product (exemplo: 4-star hotel);
  - **Competitive points of parity** - associations designed to negate
    competitors' points of difference.

## Strategic management

- **Strategy** - pattern of action or a plan that integrates the major
  objectives, policies, and actions of an organization into a coherent whole;
- **Competitive advantage** - ability of a firm to outperform its rivals:
  - Valuable and rare;
  - Costly to imitate by competitors;
  - Allows to earn above-average returns.

![competitive_advantage](img/competitive_advantage.png)

![swot](img/swot.png)

![business_strategy](img/business_strategy.png)

### Mission statement (mission+objectives definition)

- The **mission statement** of a firm focuses on its present business purpose;
- "who we are and what we do";
- Current product/service offerings;
- Customer needs being served;
- Technological and business capabilities.

### External environment

  - Criam oportunidade para que a empresa use as suas core competencies to
    achieve its vision;
  - Criam ameaças com o potencial de prevenir uma empresa de ter sucesso com as
    suas core competencies.
- Managers must **scan the external env** para:
  - Identificar developments externos importantes;
  - Assess impact and influence;
  - Adaptar a direção+strategy conforme for necessário.

### PESTEL

![pestel](img/pestel.png)

- Political - government policies and trends that affect the macro env:
  - gov instability/stability
  - decisions and policy priorities
- Economic:
  - distribution of income and purchasing power
  - changing patterns of household expenditure

  - Demographic growth
  - Changing age structure of the population
  - Changes in family structure

  - The speed of tech change
- Environmental:
  - Growing concern with environment issues
  - The limitation of natural resources
  - Pollution issues
- Legal:
  - National and Community legislation
  - Regulation of market

### Industry analysis

- **Industry analysis** - set of companies that offer products that are close
  substitutes;
- **Industry env** - tem um impacto mais direto na estratégia da empresa:
  - Empresa influencia e é influenciada pelas outras na industria;
  - É um set the fatores influenciam a empresa diretamente + ações competitivas
    e respostas.

### Porter's Five Forces of competition

- Power of suppliers - aumenta quando:
  - Há poucos suppliers e estes são grandes;
  - Não há substitutos;
  - Goods são criticos para o buyer;
  - Switching costs altos;
  - Suppliers dão threat de integrar mais deep na industria dos buyers;
  - **Exemplo:** oil industry.
- Power of buyers - aumenta quando:
  - Buyers are large e poucos;
  - The sale of product é uma parte significative dos annual revenues;
  - Buyers could easily switch to another product;
  - Buyers pose threat to integrate backward into the sellers' industry;
  - **Exemplo:** large retail chains.
- Threat of new entrants - barriers that block new entrants:
  - Economies of scale;
  - Large capital requirements;
  - Product differentiation;
  - High switching cost;
  - Patentes, etc...
  - **Exemplo:** pulp and paper industry.
- Product substitutes - threat aumenta quando:
  - Buyers face few switching costs;
  - The substitute product's price is lower;
  - Substitute product's quality and performance are equal to or greater than
    the existing product;
  - **Exemplo:** glass container industry.
- Intensity of rivalry - cut-throat competition is more likely to occur when:
  - There are numerous or equally balanced competitors;
  - Industry growth slows or declines;
  - There are high fixed costs or high storage costs;
  - Lack of differentiation;
  - Low switching costs;
  - **Exemplo:** glass container industry.

![five_forces](img/five_forces.png)

- **Competitive advantage** - is the company's ability to get superior
  performance to its rivals in a sustained way.

## Operations

- **Operations** - activities and tasks. Usualmente implicito que as tasks são
  planned e coordinated, and involve different people.

### Complementary views

- **The resource view** - focused on assets (balance sheet);
- **The process view** - focused on tasks (using assets to generate results);
- **The competencies view** - focused on characterizing what the operation can
  and cannot do.

---

- **Competitive strategy** - select industry and choose product attributes on
  which to compete;
- **Operations strategy** - focus on enabling the execution of the competitive
  strategy.

---

- **Operations management** - focus on appropriately utilizing given assets and
  processes:
  - about immediate, specific issues;
  - focus on appropriately utilizing given assets and processes.
- **Operations strategy** - focus on developing assets and configuring
  processes:
  - about future, general issues;
  - focus on developing assets and configuring processes.

### The resource view

- Organization is considered as a set of real assets:
  - tangible + human - "do" the work;
  - intangible - embody "know-how" to do the work.
- This perspective is useful to decide the amounts and types of resources the
  operation needs;

![resources_view](img/resources_view.png)

### The process view

- Purpose of resources is to work and generate value;
- Highlights how resources perform activities and add value;
- **Processes:**
  - structure, recurrent activities that transform inputs into outputs;
  - Detailed tasks: billing a customer, implementing and engineering change
    order;
  - Aggregate tasks: new product development, customer service.

![process_view](img/process_view.png)

### The competencies view

- A third factor: **values**
  - Standards by which employees set priorities;
  - As organizations become more complex, consistent values are powerful
    mechanisms for employees to make independent but consistent decisions about
    priorities.
- Competencies:
  - What the organization's resources, processes, and values allow to do (its
    abilities);
  - Determine the set of outputs, products, and services that the operation will
    be particularly good at providing;

![competencies_view](img/competencies_view.png)

---

- **Where competencies reside changes over time:**
  - They start in **resources**;
  - Gradually migrate to **processes**;
  - Eventually reside in **values**.

### Principle of alignment

Operations strategy should develop resources and configure processes such that
the resulting competencies are aligned with the competitive position that the
firm seeks over time.

![principle_of_alignment](img/principle_of_alignment.png)

It may be relevant to answer these questions in different order:

- In order to satisfy a new customer need, the firm may need to build new
  competencies, processes, and resources;
- Those processes and resources may later be used to invent new products and
  services that may drive, if not create, new markets.

## Entrepreneurship

### Company vs Startup

- **Company** - a business organization which sells a product/service in
  exchange for revenue and profit;
- **Startup** - a temporary organization designed to **search** for a
  **repeatable and scalable business model**. A startup **aims to become a
  company**.

- ~~Startups are a smaller version of a Large company~~;
- **Startups search. Companies execute**.

![search_vs_execute](img/search_vs_execute.png)

- Entrepreneurship begins with the **search** for a **business model**;
- **Experiential learning** to validate hypothesis about business model (and
  identify patterns).

### Strategic learning and Experimentation

- **Hypothesis** - "guesses" about different aspects of the business model
  (BMC);
- **Customer development process** - turning "guesses" into facts;

![customer_dev_proc](img/customer_dev_proc.png)

#### Customer discovery

1. State hypothesis -> draw BMC;
2. Test the problem -> get out of the building and test understanding of
   customer problem/need;
3. Test the solution -> build prototype and test product-market fit;
4. Verify or pivot BMC.

- **Pivot:**
  - Are possible results of hypothesis testing and experimentation (hypothesis
    testing involves failure);
  - Is a substantive change to one or more components of the BMC (iterations are
    minor changes);
  - In a pivot, dismiss hypotheses that do not match reality (but save the
    knowledge built).

#### Customer validation

1. Get ready to sell -> acquire customers + prepare distribution channels +
   build MVP;
2. Get out of the building -> "test sell" to early evangelists;
3. Develop positioning -> corporate and product positioning;
4. Verify the BMC -> pivot or proceed (repeatable and scalable?).

#### Business models

- How do we **create value**?
- How do we **deliver value** to customers?
- How do we **capture the value** delivered?

![bmc](img/bmc.png)

### Product-Market Fit

The **Value Propositions** + the **Customer Segments**.

#### Customer Segments

- **Customer Archetype**:
  - Who is the customer?
  - How does the customer buy?
  - What matters to the customer?
  - Who influences the customer? (influencer, recommender, decision maker,
    economic buyer, saboteur)
  - Market type

![market_type](img/market_type.png)

- **Job-to-be-done**:
  - What jobs are getting done?
  - What basic needs are you helping your customer satisfy?
  - What are (not) customer needs?
    - A customer need is a description of the benefits that customers want;
    - It is different from a product feature: a description of how that need
      gets satisfied;
    - To succeed at new product introduction, companies need to understand
      customer needs;
    - Customers want movies available without having to go to a store vs
      customers can order movies from the comfort of their homes.
  - What causes customers to buy a solution?
    - Customers have "jobs" that arise regularly and need to get done;
    - They look for what they can "hire" to get the job done **effectively**,
      **conveniently**, and **inexpensively**.
- **Customer workflow**:
  - What is the context in which the job arises?
  - How will the solution going to be purchased and used?
  - Draw a day in the life of the customer.
- **Current solutions**:
  - How is the job currently done?
  - What are the pros & cons of each alternative?

#### Value Propositions

- **Solution**:
  - What are you actually selling?
  - Focus on the customer;
  - MVP:
    - The minimum set of features needed to learn from early adopters (early
      evangelists);
    - Solves a core problem for customer;
    - "low fidelity" solution to get feedback from customer;
    - Later transformed into "high fidelity" solution when understanding about
      the problem is confirmed.
- **Unique Feature**:
  - What advantages set you apart from competition?
  - How protectable are they?
- **Key Benefits**:
  - How does the customer benefit from the unique features of the solution?
  - What core and additional services are part of your value proposition?

### Connecting to customers

**Customer Relationships** + **Channels** + **Revenue Streams**.

- **Channels**:
  - Types of channel used:
    - Direct/Indirect(/Licensing)
    - Virtual/Physical
    - Structure - Direct/Indirect
    - Coverage - Intensive (well known and branded products)/Selective
      (significant sales effort or strategic partnership required)
  - Channel partners:
    - Who are your channel partners? (-> **Key Partners**)
    - How and why are they interested in partnering?
  - Channel flow diagram;
  - Channel economics (-> Costs + Revenue Streams):

![channel_economics](img/channel_economics.png)

- **Customer Relationships**:
  - Strategy for Get/Keep/Grow customers:
    - How to get/keep/grow customer?
    - What key metrics/indicators to use?
  - Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) (-> Costs)
  - Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) (-> Revenue Streams)

![cac_ltv](img/cac_ltv.png)

- **Revenue Streams**:
  - Revenue model/Pricing model:
    - Direct sales; Licensing; Subscriptions; "Razor-blade" model; Leasing.
  - Payment flow;
  - Define and Size target market;
  - Sales projections (market model):
    - **top-down** - quick estimation of how attractive the market is. Forecasts
      are projected as yearly revenues;
    - 10% of a million-person market = 100 000 customers;
    - **bottom-up** - focus on individual sales first. Define fundamental unit
      of the business and sale cycle.
    - 1000 customers/month 1st year => 3000/month 3rd year.

### Operations

**Key Partners** + **Key Activities** + **Key Resources** + **Cost Structure**.

- **Key Partners**:
  - What partners are needed
  - Reasons for partnering
  - Risks and Costs
- **Key Resources & Key Activities**:
  - Most important resources;
  - Most important activities;
- **Cost Structure**:
  - Operating plan to build the business;
  - Costs associated to the operating plan;

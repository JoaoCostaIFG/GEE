# FEUP GEE 2022

This repository includes the project my group developed, some materials to study
for the exams, and the theoretical classes' slides.

## Project

This curricular unit has 3 projects: 3 case studies. I didn't get much feedback
about my projects, so I really don't know what I did wrong. Don't expect much
from this curricular unit.

**Avg. grade of the 3 projects:** 17.
